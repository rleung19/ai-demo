- [x] 7.4 Document OCI config file setup on VM in `docker/README_OCI_VM_PODMAN.md`:
  - Create `./.oci/config` file in project root (sibling to `wallets/`) with OCI credentials (tenancy, user, fingerprint, key_file, pass_phrase)
  - Create `./.oci/oci_api_key.pem` file with OCI API private key
  - Ensure both files are readable by the user running Podman
  - Document how to generate OCI API key and config file if needed (link to OCI documentation)
- [x] 7.5 Update `docker/README_OCI_VM_PODMAN.md` with recommender API deployment steps:
